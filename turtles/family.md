# PureBreeds Legend

Turtles can belong to one of 4 different Purebreed families.

Each family has a different letter assigned for its gene.
Each turtle has 20 genes in its genome. The most dominant gene determines its family.
Both parents randomly pass on 10 genes to the offspring's genetic sequence. For each slot only one parent can provide a gene. For instance, for a Nth slot gene, it can either be female parent's Nth slot gene or male parent's Nth slot gene. See the related image in DNA page.
While the quantity of genes is important for reproduction, its order in the genetic sequence is not changing the family type.
