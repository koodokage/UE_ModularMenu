# CrossBreeds

Both parents randomly pass on 10 genes to the offspring's genetic sequence. For each slot only one parent can provide a gene. For instance, for a Nth slot gene, it can either be female parent's Nth slot gene or male parent's Nth slot gene. See the related image in DNA page.
While the quantity of genes is important for reproduction, its order in the genetic sequence is not changing the family type.
