Turtle Kaiz integrates with the MetaMask.

# What is MetaMask?

MetaMask is an application that allows you to control your own assets such as tokens and NFTs. If you somehow ended up here and you do not know what the MetaMask wallet is, we recommend you to read about the MetaMask wallet first, before you dive deeper into all things Turtle Kaiz.
